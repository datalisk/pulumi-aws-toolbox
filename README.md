# Pulumi AWS Toolbox

The Pulumi AWS Toolbox is an opinionated library containing components to deploy common web applications to the AWS cloud.

It's mostly useful for projects that follow these design ideas:
* being as serverless as possible, with pay per request AWS resources while avoiding resources that incur a fixed cost per hour
* websites that are mostly static using S3 and CloudFront
* backends implemented with AWS Lambda

## Demo app
The [notebook app](https://notebook.datalisk.com) demonstrates the core components of the library. It's an open-source & serverless pastebin alternative, created with just ~100 lines of infrastructure code.


# Setup
Install with

    npm i @datalisk/pulumi-aws-toolbox

Import it into your code with

```typescript
import * as pat from "@datalisk/pulumi-aws-toolbox";
```

# Components

## Website hosting
The [StaticWebsite](src/website/StaticWebsite.ts) component creates a CloudFront distribution and a number of supporting resources to host a mostly static website. It's an opinionated component that tries to solve the common cases of website hosting.

Resources can be integrated from these sources (see "routes" argument):
 - S3: for static assets
 - Lambda: to integrate dynamic content using a Lambda function
 - SingleAsset: a useful utility to serve a single static file e.g. a environment specific config at /config.json
 - Custom: to integrate content served from a different domain / web server.

The following things happen under the hood:
- HTTPS termination is handled by CloudFront using a free HTTPS certificate from AWS.
- DNS records are created in Route53.
- HTTP basic auth protection can be enabled easily, e.g. for development.
- Access logs are stored in S3.
- Automatically sets common security headers for HTTP responses.


### S3 Integration
S3 is ideal to serve the content for a static website. To facilitate this the StaticWebsite component does the following:

- Automatically handles URL rewrites. When the user requests '/' we return '/index.html' and if requesting '/about' we will return the /about.html file from S3 (can be configured). To generate correct assets, your frontend framework must be configured correctly.
  - Svelte: use trailingSlash = 'always' (the default)
  - Astro: use build.format = 'file'
- Efficient caching. The cache-control response header is set automatically to force the browser to re-validate resources before it can use them. If you have assets that never change, configure them by setting "immutable" for a given S3 route.
- Assets are loaded from S3 specified by an S3Folder. The bucket must be provided by you, for example, using the S3ArtifactStore component. The bucket must be provided by you to cater for cases where
the bucket should be shared by several dev stacks and must therefore already exist during the CI build phase (and to support additional settings e.g. cross-account access from prod).

Example:
```typescript
// Create a S3 bucket where the website assets are stored
const artifactStore = new pat.ci.S3ArtifactStore(`my-artifact`);

// Create the CloudFront distribution
new pat.website.StaticWebsite(`my-website`, {
    acmCertificateArn_usEast1: "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:111111111111:certificate/xxxxxxxxx",
    hostedZoneId: "Z11111111111111111111",
    routes: [{
        type: RouteType.S3,
        pathPattern: "/",
        s3Folder: artifactStore.getArtifact("website", "1.0"),
    }],
});

// Allow CloudFront to read the assets from S3
artifactStore.createBucketPolicy();
```
Afterwards, upload your website assets into s3://my-artifact-xyz/website/1.0 and you're done.

Internal components:
* [CloudfrontLogBucket](src/website/CloudfrontLogBucket.ts): Creates a S3 bucket to store CloudFront standard logs.
* [SingleAssetBucket](src/website/SingleAssetBucket.ts): Creates a S3 bucket where single file assets can be stored for delivery by a CloudFront distribution.
* [ViewerRequestFunction/ViewerResponseFunction](src/website/cloudfront-function.ts): Creates a CloudFront function that processes the request/response through a chain of handlers.


## Vpc
The Vpc component is a core component that provides networking functionality. It's needed to run things like EC2 instances, ECS tasks, RDS databases, and AWS Lambda functions. It's an opionionated component focused on the use of IPv6 instead of IPv4 (no NAT gateways provided). It doesn't try to support everything and doesn't provide many configuration options.

Architecture:

![Diagram](./Vpc-Architecture.drawio.png)

It sets up subnets for three availability zones (= data centers). This allows to build applications with very high availability.

Resources in a public subnet can be reached from and can communicate to the internet via IPv4 and IPv6.
 * For IPv4 resources need to have a public IPv4 address.
 * AWS Lambda does not support public IPv4 addresses, you would need NAT gateways for this, which we don't want to use due to their cost.

Resources in a private subnet can communicate to the internet only via IPv6 and cannot be reached from the internet at all.
* By default, you should place resources that don't need to be reached from the internet here. 

Components:
* [Jumphost](src/vpc/Jumphost.ts): Creates a jumphost EC2 instance.
* [StdSecurityGroup](src/vpc/StdSecurityGroup.ts): A simple security group for many standard cases.
* [Vpc](src/vpc/Vpc.ts): the VPC component itself.

## Build
Components:
* [S3ArtifactStore](src/build/S3ArtifactStore.ts): Creates a S3 bucket where build artifacts can be stored.

## Database
Components:
* [Ec2PostgresqlDatabase](src/database/Ec2PostgresqlDatabase.ts): Creates a self-hosted postgresql database on EC2.

## Lambda
Components:
* [SimpleNodeLambda](src/lambda/SimpleNodeLambda.ts): Creates a Nodejs AWS Lambda with useful defaults for small & simple tasks.

## SES
Components:
* [SesProxyMailer](src/ses/SesProxyMailer.ts): Creates a AWS Lambda to send email using SES using IPv6 and/or from another account.


# Scripts

## pulumi-aws-login
By convention we're using Pulumi's AWS S3 backend, with a bucket named "pulumi-state-{AWS_REGION}-{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}".
You can configure Pulumi to use this bucket by running

    npx pulumi-aws-login

This will configure Pulumi to use the bucket of your current AWS account. The bucket must already exist.
